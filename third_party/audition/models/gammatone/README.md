Gammatone filterbank implementation unifies two models in one: The
reimplementation by João Felipe Santos of the original ERB filterbank by Malcolm
Slaney and the
[implementation](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Ma/resources/gammatone/)
of Ning Ma from University of Sheffield based on Martin Cooke's PhD thesis.

The original implementation of João Felipe Santos is available under the

is also available under GNU GPL Version 3 license (available in
