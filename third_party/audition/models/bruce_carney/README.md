This directory contains reimplementations of miscellaneous models developed over
the years by the researchers in [Laurel
Carney's](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/carney.aspx) and [Ian
Bruce's](https://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/) groups.

## Documentation

Various implementations in this directory have corresponding `README` files
(e.g., `fractional_gaussian_noise.README`) containing the original
documentation optionally updated with further information. Where the `README`
file is missing, the documentation can be found in the corresponding header
file.

## Licensing

*   Fractional Gaussian noise [implementation](fractional_gaussian_noise.h) is
    based on the original Matlab
    [implementation](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/29686/versions/1/previews/ffGn.m/index.html)
    by Scott Jackson available on Matlab file exchange. The packages on Matlab
    file exchange are available under [2-Clause
    BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license which we
    reproduce in our implementation.
*   Rest of the models in this directory are available under the _provisional_
    GNU GPL Version 3 license suggested by the authors. The license was
    originally suggested by the authors but is likely to change to a more
    liberal non-GPL license from the [list](https://opensource.org/licenses) of
    open-source licenses pending the final decision by the authors.

Based on the above, the code in this directory is shipped under GNU GPL version 3
license. Please see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.
