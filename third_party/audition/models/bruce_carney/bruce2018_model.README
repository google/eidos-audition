Documentation on a model of full auditory pipeline from Ian Bruce, et. al.
(2018).

The original code can be found at:
  http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/zbcANmodel/zbcANmodel.htm

The first stage of the pipeline (acoustic stimulus to IHC transmembrane
potentials) is very similar to the model of Zilany, et. al. (2014) (please
see the zilany2014_model.README file in this directory).

This is the BEZ2018 version of the code for auditory periphery model from
the Carney, Bruce and Zilany labs.

This release implements the version of the model described in:

   Bruce, I.C., Erfani, Y., and Zilany, M.S.A. (2018). "A Phenomenological
   model of the synapse between the inner hair cell and auditory nerve:
   Implications of limited neurotransmitter release sites", Hearing research,
   360, 40--54, (Special Issue on "Computational Models in Hearing").

Please cite this paper if you publish any research results obtained with
this code or any modified versions of this code.

*** Instructions ***

The Matlab and C code included with this distribution is designed to be
compiled as a Matlab MEX file, i.e., the compiled model MEX function will run
as if it were a Matlab function.  The code can be compiled within Matlab using
the function:

    mexANmodel.m

Note that it is also possible to compile and run the code in the open-source
(i.e, free!) software Octave just as it is done in Matlab, although it will
typically run more slowly in Octave.  It may be necessary to install the
"signal" and "control" packages within Octave before running the AN model code.

The code is implemented in two parts. The first function, model_IHC_BEZ2018,
takes the acousic signal as input and gives the IHC's relative transmembrane
potential (Vihc) as the output.  The second function, model_Synapse_BEZ2018,
takes Vihc as input and outputs the PSTH (or a spike train for a single stimulus
presentation).  There are also a number of additional optional outputs from
this second function - see the help information for further details. For
instructions on how to run the code, the following commands can be run at
the Matlab command prompt:

    help model_IHC_BEZ2018

    help model_Synapse_BEZ2018

We have also included:-

1. a Matlab function "generateANpopulation.m" for generating a population
   of AN fibers with the statistics for spont rate and absolute & relative
   refractory periods as described in the journal article,

2. a function "fitaudiogram2.m" for estimating the parameters for outer and
   inner hair cell impairment, Cohc and Cihc, respectively, for a given
   audiogram, and

3. a number of scripts with filenames beginning with "test..." that run
   simulations and generate figures similar to a subset of those from the
   journal article and supplementary material.
