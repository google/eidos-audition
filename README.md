## About

This library represents a simple pipeline integrating various models
of auditory periphery developed over the years in academia. The pipeline
can be used to combine models representing various stages of auditory
perception for extracting features for machine learning algorithms.

Detailed documentation for the auditory library can be found
[here](eidos/audition/README.md).
